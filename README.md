# Dental-Hygiene

## Why Does this Project Exist?
I've started tracking everything I possibly can in iOS' Health app.
Dental hygiene is an omission from the list of data I track.
Tracking dental hygiene either requires expensive electrical toothbrushes,
or that you give up the idea all together.
However, the Health app just tracks minutes you spend brushing your teeth.
This app helps you manually track the time you spend brushing your teeth.

## But What's Another Reason this Project Exists?
At WWDC 2019, Apple bestowed upon us a ton of new ways to develop apps for their platforms.
This is a way for me to play around with those new ways and develop an intuition on
"this is how you make a modern app on Apple platforms".

## Do You Accept Pull Requests?
Depends.
If the PR is an obvious fix to the existing code, I would be very grateful if you file a PR!
If, however, you PR adds a whole new feature altogether, I request you to get in touch with me first
since I am not sure what features the app should have beyond the obvious one stated above.

## The Plan
1. Get the app in a state where it can start logging time a user spends brushing their teeth.
(The project may stop right here, as most hobby projects plausibly do.)
2. Implement a nice(r) UI.
3. Think about plans for the App Store.
4. Plan for the addition of further features.
